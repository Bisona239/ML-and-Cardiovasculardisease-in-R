# Stroke Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project applies machine learning techniques to predict the occurrence of stroke using demographic and clinical health data. The workflow includes data preprocessing, missing-value imputation, class-imbalance handling, model training, hyperparameter tuning, ROC analysis, and dashboard visualisation in Power BI.

The project was developed in R and demonstrates end-to-end machine learning implementation for healthcare analytics.

## Machine Learning Models Used

The following models were implemented and compared:

| Model | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Random Forest | Ensemble classification |
| Logistic Regression | Baseline statistical model |
| Decision Tree | Interpretable classification |
| Naive Bayes | Probabilistic learning |
| Support Vector Machine (SVM) | Margin-based classification |

## Resampling Techniques

Due to severe class imbalance in stroke cases, multiple balancing methods were applied:

- Upsampling
- Downsampling
- SMOTE
- ROSE

---

## Data Preprocessing

The preprocessing workflow included:

- Missing value handling using MICE imputation
- One-hot encoding of categorical variables
- Normalisation using Min-Max scaling
- Train-test splitting
- Feature engineering

---

## Model Evaluation Metrics

Models were evaluated using:

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- Sensitivity
- Specificity
- ROC Curve
- Area Under Curve (AUC)

---

## ROC Curve Analysis

ROC curves were generated and compared across all machine learning models to evaluate classification performance and discriminative ability.

Example outputs include:

- ROC comparison plots
- Variable importance plots
- Confusion matrices
- Hyperparameter tuning plots
